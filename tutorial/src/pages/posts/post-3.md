While aluminum foil is convenient, its production and disposal have environmental impacts. Luckily, there are sustainable alternatives!

## Reusable Silicone Baking Mats

These mats replace foil for baking and roasting. They’re easy to clean and last for years.

## Beeswax Wraps

For food storage, beeswax wraps are a great substitute. They mold around food and containers, providing a natural, biodegradable option.

## Glass and Stainless Steel Containers

Instead of wrapping leftovers in foil, opt for glass or steel containers. They’re durable, reusable, and better for the planet.

Aluminum foil is undoubtedly useful, but small changes can help us balance convenience with sustainability.
