Aluminum foil may seem simple, but its properties are rooted in fascinating science. Letâ€™s break it down!

## What is Aluminum Foil?

Aluminum foil is made from pure aluminum rolled into thin sheets. Its thinness and metal composition give it unique characteristics.

## Thermal Conductivity

Aluminum is an excellent conductor of heat, which is why foil is so effective for cooking. It helps distribute heat evenly, reducing the risk of hot spots.

## Reflectivity and Insulation

Foil reflects up to 98% of radiant heat, which makes it useful for insulation. This property is why space blankets and some home insulation products incorporate aluminum foil.
