Aluminum foil is a household staple that many of us take for granted. Yet, this thin sheet of metal has a surprising range of uses beyond just wrapping leftovers.

## Cooking and Baking

Aluminum foil is a kitchen essential. It helps cook food evenly, prevents moisture loss, and makes cleanup a breeze. You can line baking trays, wrap vegetables for roasting, or even fashion a makeshift funnel in a pinch.

## Home Hacks

Beyond the kitchen, foil is a handy tool for various home hacks. Use it to scrub stubborn grime off pots and pans, sharpen scissors, or even boost your Wi-Fi signal by positioning it behind your router.

## Creative Uses

Artists and crafters use aluminum foil to create sculptures or as a reflective surface for photography. Its malleability and shine make it a versatile medium for creative projects.
